# Avali Continued
This is a GitHub repository for the Avali Continued mod and its CE patch on steam, found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1732147907

If you have old save files from 1.1 and get def errors, I reccomend installing Eriss's original (1.1). Just put that folder into Rimworld/mods and it should appear with a folder icon in the settings.

I am not the creator of this mod, Eriss is, and the source code was entirely written by Eriss. The source codes are in Eriss's original (1.1)

I encourage to make patches if you have experience in coding for this mod. I will gladly add it to the mod, or advertise it on the description of the main mod, if you wish to publish it yourself.

I don't know much on how to use GitHub and it warned me of doomsday if I publish this repository. So uhh, please don't hack me, thank you :)

# 1.2 Update
Hi, Kataris here, also new to github and stuff. I uploaded 2 new .zips for Rimworld 1.2! I've included the source for both.

I do recommend checking out ..\mods\Avali\1.2\Defs\ThingDefs_Races\Race_Avali.xml and opening it with a text editor. Be sure to look at any comments noted by me, as Rimworld Alien Races 2.0 1.2 tends to really get upset if you leave stuff in there that depends on mods you aren't using. Adjust those as you need!

# 1.2 Update Fix
Thorinair has provided a further update for the 1.2 version of the mod, applying some fixes to make it more easily runnable out of the box.

The two new ZIPs are called: `Eriss_Original_1.2_Fixed.zip` and `Eriss_Modified_1.2_Fixed.zip` and should be extracted to your game folder, as so: `<SteamLibrary>\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\Avali\...` Both the `Mods` and `Avali` folders already exist in the packed structures, so just extract accordingly.

The archives contain fixes as explained by Avanti Iceclaw in the [discussion thread](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1732147907/3010053344554354804/#c3114770279401222230), which addresses issues with equipping clothing. Additionally, the aparell added by the Save Our Ship mod has been commented out as that mod seems to have some compatibility issues when added to the game nowadays. You will still keep getting errors as explained under the **1.2 Update** section, unless you comment out parts of the code as explained there or add the following missing mods:
- [Gliter Tech](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725576127)
- [Rimatomics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127530465)
- [Advanced Shield Belts](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417354001)
- [Dubs Rimkit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=832333531)

Happy modding!
For those wondering, the mod remains compatible with the [Avali Texture Update](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2017824435) mod as well!
